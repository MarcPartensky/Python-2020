blackout i really had a blackout

if you see where i'm falling
we got to take
everything we're not fighting like we used to do
cause all these years im rocking hard
we're standing tall
we're going out with the band
we're going out with the band
i said we're gonna go out with the band

no slowing down
i cannot tell you how much
and we're never loosing time
cause all those years i've been rocking hard
we're going out with the band
i said we're gonna go out with the band

we're going out with the band
out with the band
we're going out with the band
going out with the band

i am completely dull
